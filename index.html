            <p><span id="nuevo"> Nuevoâ€™s</span> mission is to be an exciting, casual and upscale Mexican restaurant,
                 one like Akron has never seen before. The unique features of the space lend 
                 themselves well to our design concept. Artfully designed windows flood the 
                 space with natural light, making the atmosphere dynamic enough to be a destination
                  for a party of 30, or comfortable enough for a lone diner to enjoy. Our staff
                   is trained to provide top-notch service and to ensure that every customer feels
                    welcome and eager to return.
            </p>

            Nuevo is rooted in the traditional, using several modern ingredients and techniques
                     to create a whole new cuisine. The restaurant includes a tequila bar with a variety
                      of artisanal tequilas, as well as fresh, handcrafted drinks. Our extensive tequila
                       selections are paired with complementary food courses to create for an
                        unforgettable experience. Nuevo also offers a variety of wines, chosen to
                         complement our cuisine, and an extraordinary beer selection, which includes
                          our proprietary Nuevo black lager, and many other Mexican and domestic options.

                    We feature a downstairs lounge and private meeting area for large parties or groups.
                     Our outdoor patio space, modeled as an authentic Mexican plaza, makes it the most
                      exciting outdoor dining experience in Akron. Parking is never an issue since
                       the building is attached to a parking deck. Valet is offered at our main
                        entrance in the evening. In addition, there are two more parking decks
                         within one block, and the Akron Skywalk.
